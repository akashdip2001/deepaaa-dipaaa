# deepaaa-dipaaa
deep dip with aaaa

</br>
</br>

Notes:

1. The songs are pic completely randomly. The `1st sone` is influence by `Instagram 2nd story`. and the `2nd song recommended by Google music`. I really not understand the Tamil language at this time (13/09/2025). Those songs used only for friendly purpose, not for any emotional situations.

2. "deep dip" inspire by `names` which gives a unique identity of this repo, and it's also helps to recall the little story of those days.

3. `"aaaa"` is your voice action. Example: "Haaaaa..." mean "Yes" like that. It's a common action for Indian South peoples which sounds very `attractive` and `beautiful` for north (i from WB) peoples.
